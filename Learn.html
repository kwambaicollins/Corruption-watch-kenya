            <h2>What is Corruption?</h2>
            <p>Corruption is the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. It can take many forms, from large-scale political bribery to petty bribery in public services, and it affects every sector of society. Corruption is not just about money; it includes the misuse of public office, resources, and influence for personal benefit.</p>
            <p>Common examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Bribery:** Giving or receiving money, gifts, or other advantages to influence a public official's decision.</li>
                <li>**Embezzlement:** Stealing public funds or assets for personal use.</li>
                <li>**Extortion:** Forcing someone to give up something of value by using threats or force.</li>
                <li>**Nepotism and Patronage:** Favoring family, friends, or political allies in appointments, contracts, and other opportunities.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h2>Negative Effects of Corruption</h2>
            <p>Corruption has far-reaching consequences that cripple a nation's development and undermine the fabric of society. It affects everyone, but especially the poor and marginalized.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Economic Harm:** Corruption diverts funds from essential public services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. It increases the cost of doing business, discourages investment, and leads to a lack of economic opportunity.</li>
                <li>**Social Injustice:** It erodes public trust in institutions like the police, judiciary, and government. When public officials are corrupt, the rule of law is weakened, and citizens lose faith in the system, leading to social unrest and instability.</li>
                <li>**Poor Public Services:** Corrupt practices in procurement and service delivery result in substandard roads, inadequate hospitals, and poorly equipped schools. The quality of life for ordinary citizens deteriorates as services become unreliable and inefficient.</li>
                <li>**Weakened Democracy:** Corruption undermines democratic processes by allowing powerful individuals and groups to buy influence and manipulate elections, policies, and laws for their own gain.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h2>The Importance of Reporting Corruption</h2>
            <p>Reporting corruption is a powerful act of civic duty. It is the first and most critical step in holding corrupt individuals accountable and building a more transparent and ethical society. Without reports from citizens, the vast majority of corrupt acts would go unpunished, allowing a culture of impunity to thrive.</p>
            <p>By reporting, you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Help Investigations:** Your report provides the essential evidence and leads that enable anti-corruption agencies to investigate and prosecute offenders.</li>
                <li>**Protect Public Funds:** When corruption is exposed and stopped, public resources can be redirected to their intended purpose—serving the people.</li>
                <li>**Encourage Others:** Your action inspires other citizens to be vigilant and empowers communities to demand accountability from their leaders.</li>
                <li>**Reinforce the Rule of Law:** Each report strengthens the legal and institutional framework designed to combat corruption, sending a clear message that such behavior will not be tolerated.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section-card">
            <h2>Corruption and the Kenyan Constitution</h2>
            <p>The Constitution of Kenya, 2010, provides a strong legal foundation for the fight against corruption. It enshrines national values and principles of governance that are directly aimed at fostering a culture of integrity and accountability.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The national values and principles of governance include—<br>
                **(a)** patriotism, national unity, sharing and devolution of power, the rule of law, democracy and participation of the people;<br>
                **(b)** human dignity, equity, social justice, inclusiveness, equality, human rights, non-discrimination and protection of the marginalised;<br>
                **(c)** good governance, integrity, transparency and accountability; and<br>
                **(d)** sustainable development.</p>
                <cite>— Article 10, Constitution of Kenya</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Furthermore, Chapter Six of the Constitution, titled **"Leadership and Integrity,"** sets out specific ethical standards for state officers. It emphasizes that those in public office must be beyond reproach and must not abuse their power for personal gain. This chapter lays the groundwork for laws like the Leadership and Integrity Act, which provide for the removal of public officers who fail to meet these standards.</p>

            <p>The Constitution also mandates the creation of independent commissions to enforce these principles, such as the **Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC)**, as stipulated in **Article 79**.</p>
